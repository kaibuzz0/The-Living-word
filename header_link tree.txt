## Structure Template:
Filled-vX-FractalTreeMap-0.0.XXX-[descriptor]  
🔗 Bound to: [immediate-previous-map-version]  
🔗 Bound to: Language Map v0.4.1-beta

## Component Definitions:
- Filled-vX-FractalTreeMap:
  ▸ "Filled" is the static prefix.
  ▸ "vX" is the major version tree (e.g., v2, v3, etc.).
  ▸ "FractalTreeMap" identifies this as a fractal structuring map.

- 0.0.XXX:
  ▸ This is the incremental minor version number.
  ▸ Always increase by 1 with each new map (e.g., 0.0.014 → 0.0.015).

- [descriptor]:
  ▸ One-word lowercase tag describing this version’s focus (e.g., signalmesh, energyflux, nodeprotocols).

- 🔗 Bound to:
  ▸ First link always points to the most recent *functional parent map*.
  ▸ Second link always points to the persistent Language Map (usually Language Map v0.4.1-beta).

## Sample Header:
Filled-v2-FractalTreeMap-0.0.016-energyflux  
🔗 Bound to: Filled-FractalTreeMap-0.0.008-signalmesh  
🔗 Bound to: Language Map v0.4.1-beta

## Usage:
1. Begin each new map with this header format.
2. Maintain strict version linking to ensure traceable upgrades.
3. Follow immediately with properly structured subfolders, sub-subfolders, and modules for continuity.
4. When generating or expanding maps, the AI must:
   - Duplicate from the prior version’s tree structure.
   - Add or expand new protocols based on current focus.
   - Retain format, indentation, and consistency throughout.
5. Do not skip version increments.
6. Wait for user to say “Next” before proceeding.

## Trigger Words:
- “Next” → Initiates new version with +1 increment.
- “Fix and continue” → Correct prior version, preserve link logic.
- “Proceed” → Continue current thread without version increment.
